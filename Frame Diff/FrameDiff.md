Frame differencing is an unsupervised method for object detection. This method is based on image segmentation, specifically on active contours. 

To run the program, first run Frames.py to extract all the frames from a video file and place these frames inside the Frames directory. 
Next, you are ready to run frame differencing by just running the file Frame_Differencing.py
